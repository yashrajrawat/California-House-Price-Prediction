# California-House-Price-Prediction
Here in this business problem, we want to find out the prices of Houses in California, USA. Here we are given many parameters which directly influence the prices of the houses. We need to find the best quoted value for the price considering all the dependent parameters and we need to observe which parameters plays a key role in price determination of the houses.
### Since this is a problem of PREDICTION ANALYSIS we will use MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS.
MULTIPLE REGRESSION: Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It is used when we want to predict the value of an dependent variable based on the value of two or more other independent variables. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome, target or criterion variable).
The California house data csv file contains our complete dataset. This data is colleceted through surveys and by estimation of analysts. We have total 21640 historical data prices for houses in USA.
